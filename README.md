# Bayesian Uncertainty Modeling for Large-Scale Project Management

This repository contains the research workflow, code, experiments, and datasets for a doctoral-level project on modeling uncertainty in large-scale construction and infrastructure projects using Bayesian probabilistic methods.

The project focuses on developing a unified Bayesian framework that integrates:
- Bayesian time-series forecasting
- Hierarchical modeling for correlated project components
- Probabilistic cost–schedule risk propagation
- Scenario-based decision optimization under uncertainty

The goal is to create a robust, extensible, and real-world applicable modeling pipeline suitable for publication and funding proposals.

## 1. Objectives

### Primary Objective
Develop a Bayesian probabilistic model capable of forecasting cost and schedule behavior in complex multi-phase construction projects, with accurate uncertainty quantification.

### Secondary Objectives
- Analyze real-world megaproject datasets and identify structural sources of uncertainty.
- Compare Bayesian modeling (PyMC / PyStan) with classical Monte Carlo simulation.
- Build a synthetic dataset generator for benchmarking models.
- Provide reproducible notebooks, experiments, and documentation.

## 3. How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Create virtual environment

### Step 2: Install dependencies

### Step 3: Generate synthetic data (optional)

### Step 4: Run notebooks
Open any notebook through Jupyter or Google Colab.

## 4. Synthetic Data Generator

The script `generate_synthetic.py` creates realistic project-level data including:
- Activity durations
- Cost escalation patterns
- Risk events
- Time-series progress curves

These synthetic datasets help benchmark the Bayesian models before real data is added.

## 5. Real Data (to be added)

When available, real datasets from large infrastructure and construction projects will be added to:


and documented inside:

## 6. Research Questions

1. How accurately can Bayesian hierarchical models capture cross-activity correlations in megaprojects?
2. How does a Bayesian approach compare to classical Monte Carlo simulation in uncertainty propagation?
3. Can we build a real-world validated decision-making tool using posterior predictive distributions?
